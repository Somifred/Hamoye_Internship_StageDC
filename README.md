Introduction: The global food shortage is a critical issue affecting millions of people worldwide. Despite advancements in agricultural technology and food distribution networks, many regions still face significant challenges in ensuring food security. Understanding the intricate dynamics between food production and consumption is essential to develop effective strategies to combat this issue. This study leverages a comprehensive dataset on food production and consumption/supply to explore potential solutions to the world food shortage problem.

Objective: The primary objective of this project is to analyze the food production and consumption/supply dataset to identify patterns, trends, and correlations that can inform actionable strategies for alleviating global food shortages. By utilizing appropriate data visualizations, we aim to tell a compelling story that highlights key insights and makes each variable in the dataset purposeful without omitting any crucial information.

Data Description: The dataset includes the following key variables:

** Country:** The name of the country where the data was collected. ** Item:** The type of food product (e.g., Wheat and products). ** Year:** The year of data collection. ** Value: **The quantitative measure of the food product, either in production or consumption terms.
